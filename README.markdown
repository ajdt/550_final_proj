# Background #
This code outline was initially part of a course project for a graduate level software systems class at UW. We were to explore 
the problem of organizing *n* idential robots into an arbitrary shape. We modelled the robots as disk-shaped and moving over a 2d plane,
with each robot having a *possibly* different compass orientationthan the others. Due to power constraints these
robots could not communicate with one another, but they could observe the world in all directions as far as their line of sight
would allow.

# So where's the code? #
The project took on a theory-flavor instead of an implementation-based one, so we've left this code alone. 
Basically, we ended up coming up with algorithms and proving run-time and other properties about them rather
than running simulations. I will probably revisit this project at a later date.
